# Sentiment_analysis_hugging_face
This notebook is doing sentiment analysis on the reviews scraped form yelp and on the tweets scraped from the twitter without using twitter API. This will give you a basic hands-on experience of the data-scraping from different websites multiple-pages, pre-process it to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews and tweets using the pre-trained models from hugging-face. 

If this helps you in anyway, give this repo a star as a token of appreciation.
